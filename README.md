# fcc-survey-form
A survey form I created for freeCodeCamp.

Something that has been sitting in my [codepen](https://codepen.io/thesilversoul/pen/QWPXrLe) for ages. I made it back when I was doing the responsive web design curriculum in freeCodeCamp. It has been sitting there for quite a while until I started doing the Odin Project and learned about git and github. Even so it took me this long to decide that I should bring it over here even after I breezed past the git section a long time ago.
